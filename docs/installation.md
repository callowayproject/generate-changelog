## Installing the Stable Release from PyPI

To install generate-changelog, run this command in your terminal:

``` console
$ pip install generate-changelog
```

This is the preferred method to install `generate-changelog`, as it will always install the most recent stable release. You can also replace `pip` with `pipx`.
