## Getting started with development

### Setup

There are several ways to create your isolated environment. This is the default method.

Run the following in a terminal:

1. Clone the repository
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/coordt/generate-changelog.git
    ```
2. Enter the repository
   ```console
   cd generate-changelog
   ```
3. Create then activate a virtual environment
   ```console
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the development requirements
   ```console
   python -m pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
   ```

### Run tests

Once setup, you should be able to run tests:
```
pytest
```

## Install Pre-commit Hooks


Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run every time you make a commit. If any of the scripts fail, it stops the commit. You can see a listing of the checks in the ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file.

```
pre-commit install
```
